NEWS file for obbench
=====================

Version 0.5, released 2015-12-31
--------------------------------

* Bug fix for `obnam_config` implementation. I should've written
  tests.

Version 0.4, released 2015-12-31
--------------------------------

* Put the spec file on the front page of HTML output, and the spec for
  each benchmark on the benchmark's HTML page.

* Actually obey the `obnam_config` part of the spec file. Oops.

Version 0.3, released 2015-12-27
--------------------------------

* Produce some progress reporting so it's not so boring to watch a
  benchmark run. This includes letting Obnam produce progress
  reporting.

Version 0.2, released 2015-12-27
--------------------------------

* Fix updating a git clone.

Version 0.1, released 2015-12-26
