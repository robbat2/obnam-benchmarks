NEWS file for obbench
=====================

Version 0.8, released 2016-02-06
--------------------------------

* Fix bugs that prevent having multiple runs or multiple benchmarks.

Version 0.7, released 2016-01-16
--------------------------------

* Fix the `restore part` **again**. This time it was breaking because
  the temporary directory to which restores happen gets reused, and
  the second time it fails, 'cause it needs to be empty, 'cause I said
  so.

Version 0.6, released 2016-01-01
--------------------------------

* Fix the `restore` part of a benchmark so it actually works.

Version 0.5, released 2015-12-31
--------------------------------

* Bug fix for `obnam_config` implementation. I should've written
  tests.

Version 0.4, released 2015-12-31
--------------------------------

* Put the spec file on the front page of HTML output, and the spec for
  each benchmark on the benchmark's HTML page.

* Actually obey the `obnam_config` part of the spec file. Oops.

Version 0.3, released 2015-12-27
--------------------------------

* Produce some progress reporting so it's not so boring to watch a
  benchmark run. This includes letting Obnam produce progress
  reporting.

Version 0.2, released 2015-12-27
--------------------------------

* Fix updating a git clone.

Version 0.1, released 2015-12-26
--------------------------------

* First release after a rewrite.
